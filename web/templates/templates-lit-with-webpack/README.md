# LitElement Templates

!!! This version of templates is not currently usable.
This templates use webpack for bundling in an attempt to use scss with lit elements while using the LIGHT DOM.
At the moment we cannot upload the templates in LEYA's Designer because of how webpack bundles the data.
This type of template will be revisted at a later time because updates have to be made to LEYA as well.

This project has the purpose of showcasing how to use litElement to create templates for Leya.
Sample components using LitElement with TypeScript can be found in the /src/lit-templates folder.
The .scss files are not used, the files are there to show how the manual css from each component can be translated from css.

This template is generated from the `lit-starter-ts` package in [the main Lit
repo](https://github.com/lit/lit). Issues and PRs for this template should be filed in that repo.
